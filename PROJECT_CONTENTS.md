This project was produced as a ``coding demo/test''.

This file contains the assignment instructions; README.md contains the normal project-specific stuff that one would expect to find in a README.

# Objective goals:

Automate the configuration and installation of Nginx on a Linux system, ideally RedHat, CentOS, or Fedora.

* Nginx should listen on port 8888.
* The content served should be [a simple 'Hello, world!  We're here and responding' type of message].
